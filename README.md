====================================================================================================================================
* Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store 
* The class should have the following fields:
* description: The description field references a String object that holds a brief description of the item
* unitsOnHand: The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units currently in inventory
* price: The price field is a double that holds the itemâ€™s retail price
* Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each field, appropriate mutator methods that store values in these fields and
* accessor methods that return the values in these fields.
* Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates 3 RetailItem objects & stores the following data in them:

Item #      Description 		Units 	        Price
------------------------------------------------------			
Item #1 	Jacket 				12 				59.95
Item #2 	Designer Jeans 		40 				34.95
Item #3 	Shirt 				20 				24.95
